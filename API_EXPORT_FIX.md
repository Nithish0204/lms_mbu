# ✅ API Export Fix - Compilation Error Resolved!

## 🐛 **Error Encountered:**

```
Failed to compile.

Attempted import error: 'courseAPI' is not exported from '../api' (imported as 'courseAPI').
ERROR in ./src/components/CreateCourse.js 252:20-42
export 'courseAPI' (imported as 'courseAPI') was not found in '../api' (possible exports: authAPI, default)
```

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**

The `/frontend/src/api.js` file was missing the `courseAPI` export (and other API exports). It only had:

- ✅ `authAPI` - for authentication
- ❌ Missing: `courseAPI`, `enrollmentAPI`, `assignmentAPI`, `submissionAPI`, `gradeAPI`

---

## ✅ **Fix Applied:**

### Updated `/frontend/src/api.js`

Added all missing API exports:

```javascript
// Auth API (already existed)
export const authAPI = {
  register: (userData) => api.post("/auth/register", userData),
  login: (credentials) => api.post("/auth/login", credentials),
  logout: () => api.post("/auth/logout"),
  getMe: () => api.get("/auth/me"),
};

// Course API (NEWLY ADDED)
export const courseAPI = {
  getAllCourses: () => api.get("/courses"),
  getCourse: (id) => api.get(`/courses/${id}`),
  getMyCourses: () => api.get("/courses/my-courses"),
  createCourse: (courseData) => api.post("/courses", courseData),
  updateCourse: (id, courseData) => api.put(`/courses/${id}`, courseData),
  deleteCourse: (id) => api.delete(`/courses/${id}`),
  getCourseStudents: (id) => api.get(`/courses/${id}/students`),
};

// Enrollment API (NEWLY ADDED)
export const enrollmentAPI = {
  enroll: (courseId) => api.post("/enrollments", { courseId }),
  getMyEnrollments: () => api.get("/enrollments/my-enrollments"),
  checkEnrollment: (courseId) => api.get(`/enrollments/check/${courseId}`),
  unenroll: (enrollmentId) => api.delete(`/enrollments/${enrollmentId}`),
  getMyStudents: () => api.get("/enrollments/my-students"),
};

// Assignment API (NEWLY ADDED)
export const assignmentAPI = {
  createAssignment: (assignmentData) =>
    api.post("/assignments", assignmentData),
  getAssignmentsByCourse: (courseId) =>
    api.get(`/assignments/course/${courseId}`),
  getAssignment: (id) => api.get(`/assignments/${id}`),
  getMyAssignments: () => api.get("/assignments/my-assignments"),
  updateAssignment: (id, assignmentData) =>
    api.put(`/assignments/${id}`, assignmentData),
  deleteAssignment: (id) => api.delete(`/assignments/${id}`),
};

// Submission API (NEWLY ADDED)
export const submissionAPI = {
  submitAssignment: (formData) =>
    api.post("/submissions", formData, {
      headers: { "Content-Type": "multipart/form-data" },
    }),
  getMySubmissions: () => api.get("/submissions/my-submissions"),
  getSubmissionsByAssignment: (assignmentId) =>
    api.get(`/submissions/assignment/${assignmentId}`),
  getSubmissionsByCourse: (courseId) =>
    api.get(`/submissions/course/${courseId}`),
  getSubmission: (id) => api.get(`/submissions/${id}`),
  updateSubmission: (id, formData) =>
    api.put(`/submissions/${id}`, formData, {
      headers: { "Content-Type": "multipart/form-data" },
    }),
  deleteSubmission: (id) => api.delete(`/submissions/${id}`),
  downloadSubmission: (id) =>
    api.get(`/submissions/${id}/download`, { responseType: "blob" }),
};

// Grade API (NEWLY ADDED)
export const gradeAPI = {
  gradeSubmission: (submissionId, gradeData) =>
    api.post(`/grades/${submissionId}`, gradeData),
  updateGrade: (submissionId, gradeData) =>
    api.put(`/grades/${submissionId}`, gradeData),
  getMyGrades: () => api.get("/grades/my-grades"),
  getStudentGradesByCourse: (studentId, courseId) =>
    api.get(`/grades/student/${studentId}/course/${courseId}`),
  getCourseGradesOverview: (courseId) =>
    api.get(`/grades/course/${courseId}/overview`),
};
```
