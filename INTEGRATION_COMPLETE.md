# LMS Backend Integration - Complete

## âœ… Completed Integration Tasks

### 1. Authentication Middleware

- Created `/backend/middleware/auth.js` with JWT token verification
- Added `protect` middleware for route authentication
- Added `authorize` middleware for role-based access control (Teacher/Student)

### 2. Course Management

**Controller:** `/backend/controllers/courseController.js`
**Routes:** `/backend/routes/courseRoutes.js`

Implemented endpoints:

- `POST /api/courses` - Create course (Teacher only, auto-assigns teacher ID from JWT)
- `GET /api/courses` - Get all courses (Public)
- `GET /api/courses/:id` - Get single course
- `GET /api/courses/my-courses` - Get teacher's courses (Protected)
- `PUT /api/courses/:id` - Update course (Teacher only, ownership check)
- `DELETE /api/courses/:id` - Delete course (Teacher only, ownership check)

**Fix Applied:** Automatically assigns `req.user._id` as the teacher when creating a course, resolving the "teacher is required" error.

### 3. Enrollment Management

**Controller:** `/backend/controllers/enrollmentController.js`
**Routes:** `/backend/routes/enrollmentRoutes.js`

Implemented endpoints:

- `POST /api/enrollments` - Enroll in course (Student only, duplicate check)
- `GET /api/enrollments` - Get all enrollments (Protected)
- `GET /api/enrollments/my-enrollments` - Get student's enrollments (Protected)
- `GET /api/enrollments/check/:courseId` - Check if enrolled (Protected)
- `DELETE /api/enrollments/:id` - Unenroll (Protected, ownership check)

### 4. Assignment Management

**Controller:** `/backend/controllers/assignmentController.js`
**Routes:** `/backend/routes/assignmentRoutes.js`

Implemented endpoints:

- `POST /api/assignments` - Create assignment (Teacher only)
- `GET /api/assignments` - Get all assignments (Protected)
- `GET /api/assignments/my-assignments` - Get user's assignments (Protected)
- `GET /api/assignments/course/:courseId` - Get assignments by course (Protected)
- `GET /api/assignments/:id` - Get single assignment (Protected)
- `PUT /api/assignments/:id` - Update assignment (Teacher only)
- `DELETE /api/assignments/:id` - Delete assignment (Teacher only)

### 5. Grade Management

**Controller:** `/backend/controllers/gradeController.js`
**Routes:** `/backend/routes/gradeRoutes.js`

Implemented endpoints:

- `POST /api/grades/:submissionId` - Grade submission (Teacher only)
- `PUT /api/grades/:submissionId` - Update grade (Teacher only)
- `GET /api/grades` - Get all grades (Protected)
- `GET /api/grades/my-grades` - Get student's grades (Student only)

### 6. Frontend API Integration

**Fixed Components:**

- `Assignments.js` - Now imports and uses `assignmentAPI` from `../api`
- `Grades.js` - Now imports and uses `gradeAPI` from `../api`
- Both components now properly handle axios responses with `.data`

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Authentication Flow

1. User registers/logs in via `authAPI`
2. JWT token stored in localStorage
3. Axios interceptor automatically attaches token to all requests
4. Backend middleware verifies token and attaches user to `req.user`
5. Controllers use `req.user._id` and `req.user.role` for authorization

### Security Features

- JWT token verification on protected routes
- Role-based access control (Teacher/Student)
- Ownership checks (users can only modify their own resources)
- Duplicate enrollment prevention
- Teacher-only course creation with auto-assignment

### Data Population

- Courses populate teacher info (name, email)
- Enrollments populate course and teacher details
- Assignments populate course information
- Grades populate student and assignment details

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps for Full Integration

### Frontend Components Needing Integration:

1. **StudentDashboard.js** - Add API calls to fetch:

   - Enrolled courses (`enrollmentAPI.getMyEnrollments()`)
   - Recent assignments
   - Recent grades

2. **TeacherDashboard.js** - Add API calls to fetch:

   - Created courses (`courseAPI.getMyCourses()`)
   - Total students count
   - Recent assignments

3. **MyCourses.js** - Add API calls to fetch:
   - Teacher: `courseAPI.getMyCourses()`
   - Student: `enrollmentAPI.getMyEnrollments()`

### Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Register as Teacher
- [ ] Login as Teacher
- [ ] Create a course (should now work without "teacher is required" error)
- [ ] View created courses
- [ ] Register as Student
- [ ] Login as Student
- [ ] Browse courses
- [ ] Enroll in a course
- [ ] View enrolled courses
- [ ] View assignments
- [ ] View grades

## ðŸš€ How to Test

1. **Backend** (already running on port 5001):

   ```bash
   cd /Users/nani/Lms/backend
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Frontend**:

   ```bash
   cd /Users/nani/Lms/frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Test Course Creation**:
   - Login as Teacher
   - Navigate to Create Course
   - Fill in title, description, duration
   - Submit - should now successfully create course with teacher auto-assigned!

## ðŸ”‘ Environment Variables

**Backend (.env):**

- `PORT=5001`
- `MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/lms`
- `JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key`
- `JWT_EXPIRE=7d`
- `NODE_ENV=development`

**Frontend (.env):**

- `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5001/api`

## ðŸ“¦ Models

All models are properly defined with:

- Course: title, description, teacher (ref), createdAt
- Assignment: title, description, course (ref), dueDate, createdAt
- Grade: student (ref), assignment (ref), score, feedback, createdAt
- Enrollment: student (ref), course (ref), enrolledAt
- User: name, email, password, role

## âœ¨ Key Improvements Made

1. **Automatic Teacher Assignment**: Course creation now automatically uses the authenticated user's ID
2. **Proper API Imports**: Fixed Assignments.js and Grades.js to import from `../api`
3. **Response Handling**: All components properly access `.data` from axios responses
4. **Authentication**: All sensitive routes protected with JWT middleware
5. **Authorization**: Role-based access control implemented
6. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and validation
7. **Data Relationships**: Proper MongoDB population for related data

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status

âœ… Backend fully integrated with authentication and authorization
âœ… All major API endpoints implemented
âœ… Frontend API calls properly configured
âœ… Course creation bug fixed (teacher auto-assignment)
âœ… Backend server running on port 5001
âœ… MongoDB connected and ready

**Ready for testing!** ðŸš€
