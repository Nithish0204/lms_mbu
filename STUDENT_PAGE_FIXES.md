## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### **Bug #1: Multiple Course Enrollment Not Working** ✅

**Problem:**

- Students could only enroll in one course
- Subsequent enrollment attempts would fail silently
- State wasn't updating properly after enrollment

**Root Cause:**

- State updates in `handleEnroll` were not using functional form
- This caused stale closure issues where the state wouldn't update properly for multiple enrollments

**Solution:**

```javascript
// BEFORE (Bug):
setEnrolling({ ...enrolling, [courseId]: true });
setEnrolledCourseIds([...enrolledCourseIds, courseId]);

// AFTER (Fixed):
setEnrolling((prev) => ({ ...prev, [courseId]: true }));
setEnrolledCourseIds((prev) => [...prev, courseId]);
```

**Files Modified:**

- `frontend/src/components/BrowseCourses.js`

**Result:**
✅ Students can now enroll in unlimited courses
✅ Each enrollment updates state correctly
✅ "Enroll Now" button properly changes to "Enrolled" for each course

---

### **Bug #2: Wrong Navbar Showing in Browse Courses Page** ✅

**Problem:**

- After clicking "Browse Courses", the public navbar (with Login/Register buttons) appeared
- Should show authenticated user's dashboard navbar instead
- Only happened on `/courses` route

**Root Cause:**

- `/courses` route wasn't included in the `isDashboardPage` check in App.js
- App was treating it as a public page instead of protected dashboard page

**Solution:**

```javascript
// BEFORE:
const isDashboardPage =
  location.pathname === "/student-dashboard" ||
  location.pathname === "/teacher-dashboard" ||
  location.pathname === "/create-course" ||
  location.pathname === "/my-courses" ||
  location.pathname === "/profile";

// AFTER:
const isDashboardPage =
  location.pathname === "/student-dashboard" ||
  location.pathname === "/teacher-dashboard" ||
  location.pathname === "/create-course" ||
  location.pathname === "/my-courses" ||
  location.pathname === "/courses" ||
  location.pathname === "/assignments" ||
  location.pathname === "/grades" ||
  location.pathname === "/profile";
```

**Files Modified:**

- `frontend/src/App.js`

**Result:**
✅ Browse Courses page now hides public navbar
✅ Consistent UI across all dashboard pages
✅ Also fixed for `/assignments` and `/grades` routes

---

### **Bug #3: Student Dashboard Recent Activity Not Working** ✅

**Problem:**

- "Recent Activity" section always showed "No recent activity"
- Didn't display any enrolled courses
- Static placeholder with no functionality

**Root Cause:**

- Section was hardcoded with empty state
- Not connected to enrolledCourses data
- No logic to display actual enrollment data

**Solution:**
Completely rewrote the section to:

- Show loading spinner while fetching data
- Display empty state if no enrollments
- Show list of recently enrolled courses (up to 5)
- Each course shows:
  - Course title
  - Enrollment date
  - "View →" link to My Courses
- If more than 5 courses, show "View all X courses →" link

**Features Added:**

```javascript
// Dynamic rendering based on data:
{loading ? (
  <LoadingSpinner />
) : enrolledCourses.length === 0 ? (
  <EmptyState />
) : (
  <CourseList />
)}

// Each course card shows:
- Course icon with primary color
- Course title
- "Enrolled on [date]"
- Link to view in My Courses
```

**Files Modified:**

- `frontend/src/components/StudentDashboard.js`

**Result:**
✅ Shows actual enrolled courses
✅ Beautiful card layout with icons
✅ Clickable links to navigate
✅ Shows enrollment dates
✅ Loading and empty states handled
✅ Shows up to 5 recent courses with "View all" link

---

### **Bug #4: Teacher Dashboard Recent Activity Not Working** ✅

**Problem:**

- "Recent Activity" section always showed "No recent activity"
- Didn't display created courses
- Static placeholder with no functionality

**Root Cause:**

- Section was hardcoded with empty state
- Not connected to courses data
- No logic to display actual course data

**Solution:**
Completely rewrote the section to:

- Show loading spinner while fetching data
- Display empty state if no courses created
- Show list of recently created courses (up to 5)
- Each course shows:
  - Course title
  - Creation date
  - "Manage →" link to My Courses
- If more than 5 courses, show "View all X courses →" link

**Features Added:**

```javascript
// Dynamic rendering based on data:
{loading ? (
  <LoadingSpinner />
) : courses.length === 0 ? (
  <EmptyState />
) : (
  <CourseList />
)}

// Each course card shows:
- Course icon with primary color
- Course title
- "Created on [date]"
- Link to manage in My Courses
```

**Files Modified:**

- `frontend/src/components/TeacherDashboard.js`

**Result:**
✅ Shows actual created courses
✅ Beautiful card layout with icons
✅ Clickable links to manage courses
✅ Shows creation dates
✅ Loading and empty states handled
✅ Shows up to 5 recent courses with "View all" link

## 📊 Technical Details

### State Management Fixes

**Problem Pattern:**

```javascript
// ❌ Bad: Stale closure issue
const [state, setState] = useState([]);
setState([...state, newItem]); // Uses stale 'state'
```

**Solution Pattern:**

```javascript
// ✅ Good: Functional update
const [state, setState] = useState([]);
setState((prev) => [...prev, newItem]); // Uses latest state
```

### Routing Configuration

**Updated Routes:**

```javascript
// Protected routes that hide public navbar:
- /student-dashboard
- /teacher-dashboard
- /create-course
- /my-courses
- /courses ← ADDED
- /assignments ← ADDED
- /grades ← ADDED
- /profile
```

### UI Components Structure

**Recent Activity/Courses Section:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Recently [Enrolled/Created] Courses │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Loading Spinner]                   │ ← While fetching
│              OR                      │
│ [Empty State + CTA]                 │ ← No data
│              OR                      │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ 📘 Course Title                 │ │
│ │ Enrolled/Created on MM/DD/YYYY  │ │
│ │                       View → ✓  │ │
│ └─────────────────────────────────┘ │
│ [... up to 5 courses]               │
│ View all X courses →                │ ← If > 5 courses
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```
