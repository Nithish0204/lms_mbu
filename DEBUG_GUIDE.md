## 🐛 Bug Fix: Courses Not Visible After Creation

### Problem Identified

After course creation, the success message appeared but courses were not visible in the Teacher Dashboard.

### Root Cause

The `TeacherDashboard` component had:

1. Hardcoded course count as `0`
2. No API call to fetch teacher's courses
3. No display section for showing actual courses

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. **Added Course Fetching Logic**

```javascript
// Fetch teacher's courses
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchCourses = async () => {
    if (!user) return;

    console.log("=== [TeacherDashboard] Fetching courses ===");
    setLoading(true);

    try {
      const response = await courseAPI.getMyCourses();
      const coursesData = response.data.courses || [];
      setCourses(coursesData);
      console.log(`✅ [TeacherDashboard] Loaded ${coursesData.length} courses`);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("❌ [TeacherDashboard] Error fetching courses:", error);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  fetchCourses();
}, [user]);
```

#### 2. **Updated Course Count Display**

Changed from hardcoded `0` to dynamic `{courses.length}`

#### 3. **Added "My Courses" Section**

Created a new section that:

- Shows loading spinner while fetching
- Displays all courses in a grid layout
- Shows "No courses" message if empty
- Links to create new course

- Is backend returning courses?
- Are courses being set in state?

#### Issue: Authentication errors

**Check logs for:**

- Token present in localStorage?
- Token being sent in API headers?

#### Issue: Course creation fails

**Check logs for:**

- User authenticated as Teacher?
- Course data valid?
- MongoDB connection active?

## 🎯 Next Steps

After verifying basic flow works:

1. **Test Student Flow:**

   - Register as Student
   - Browse courses
   - Enroll in courses

2. **Test Assignment Flow:**

   - Create assignments
   - Submit assignments
   - Grade submissions

3. **Test Error Cases:**
   - Invalid login
   - Unauthorized access
   - Missing required fields
